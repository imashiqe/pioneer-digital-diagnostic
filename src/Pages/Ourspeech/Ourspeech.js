    <p>Physical soundness faces illness as life faces death. During illness, we want proper treatment. So we go to the doctor at the hospital or clinic. The variation of causes of disease creates variation in the treatment system, center & server. By expending a huge amount of money we get inappropriate treatment in the name of proper treatment when we fail to select skilled and specialist physicians for a particular disease. It is disclosed when a physician prescribes unnecessary pathological tests and medicine due to get the unauthorized commission. Getting treatment at a cheaper rate may be impossible in this high rising period of a good price rate. It is very tough for the major portion of our people. It results in unexpected and pathetic death without treatment.
